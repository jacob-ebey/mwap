# Pages

In MWAP a page is represented by an array of page definitions exported from `pages/index.ts`, `pages/index.tsx`, `pages/index.js` or `pages/index.jsx`.

Pages are defined as a React Component and a few simple properties:

<Code language="ts" code={pageTypes} />

Any other component defined in the `pages` directory will be automatically code-split via `@mwap/async`. This means you can use standard import statements in your `pages/index.xx` file leaving it looking like:

<Code language="ts" code={pageExampleWithAbout} />
