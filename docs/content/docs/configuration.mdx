# MWAP Configuration

MWAP allows you to easily tap into the webpack configuration through the `mwap.config.js` file in the root of your project.

Providing access to the webpack config gives you almost unlimited possibilities in the type of content you can import into your applications.

A custom `mwap.config.js` might look something like:

<Code language="tsx" code={configuration} />
