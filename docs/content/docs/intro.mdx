# Getting Started

Welcome to the Micro Web App Platform documentation!

## Quick Start

We recommend creating a new MWAP app by using [create-mwap-app](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-mwap-app) and choosing from one of the official boilerplates:

<Code language="git" code={createAppExample} />

- **minimal** - [source](https://github.com/jacob-ebey/mwap/tree/main/examples/minimal)
- **tailwindcss** - [source](https://github.com/jacob-ebey/mwap/tree/main/examples/tailwindcss)

After the installation is complete, follow the instructions to start the development server. Try editing pages/home.tsx and see the result on your browser.

For more information on how to use create-mwap-app, you can review the [create-mwap-app](https://github.com/jacob-ebey/mwap/tree/main/packages/create-mwap-app) docs.

## Manual Setup

Install `react` and `react-dom` in your project:

<Code language="git" code={installReactExample} />

Install the MWAP platform in your project:

<Code language="git" code={installMwapExample} />

Open `package.json` and add the following scripts:

<Code language="json" code={scriptsExample} />

- `dev` - Runs mwap dev which starts your app in development mode
- `build` - Runs mwap build which builds the application for production usage
- `start` - Runs mwap start which starts your bundled app in production mode

Next we will introduce a page to our application by creating a `pages/home.tsx` file that exports a simple React component:

<Code language="tsx" code={homePageExample} />

Now we will expose the Home component by creating a `pages/index.ts` file and assigning our home component to a page:

<Code language="tsx" code={pagesExample} />

Don't worry about code-splitting, anything that lives under `pages/*` or `components/**/async/*` are automatically code split and pre-loaded.

To start a development server run `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`. Visit [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) to view your application.

So far, we get:

- Automatic compilation and bundling (with webpack and esbuild)
- React Fast Refresh
- Server-side rendering of `./pages/index`
- Static file serving. `./public/` is mapped to `/`
